# A Memorial App for Dad

This project is made to somewhat commerate the life of my father who passed away 08.08.2022.

## Why did you make this?

Good question, in my mind this is something that I can do to help consolidate a lot of small things he worked on. From photos, to illustrations and also his unfinished semi-autobiographical short story titled "The Boy with the Chocolate Leg."

This wasn't made for anyone in particular, but I'm happy to share it with all, especially those who didn't know John.
