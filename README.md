# A Memorial App for Dad

This project is made to somewhat commerate the life of my father who passed away 08.08.2022.

## Why did I make this?

Good question, in my mind this is something that I can do to help consolidate a lot of small things he worked on. From photos, to illustrations and also his unfinished semi-autobiographical short story titled "The Boy with the Chocolate Leg."
